# Distribution based MIL pooling filters: experiments on a lymph node metastases dataset

This repository is the official implementation of [Distribution based MIL pooling filters: experiments on a lymph node metastases dataset](https://paper_link). 


There are different pooling filters used in multiple instance learning (MIL) models. This study analyzes performances of MIL models with different pooling filters in distinct tasks on [the CAMELYON16 lymph node metastases dataset](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.14585):
* [MIL tasks on a digital histopathology image patches dataset](MIL_tasks_on_histopathology_image_patches)
* [CAMELYON16 whole slide image classification](CAMELYON16_WSI_classification)

For each section, we have a corresponding folder. The detailed steps for reproducing the results in each section are described inside the folders.
